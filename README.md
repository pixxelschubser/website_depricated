Latest running deployment: https://personal-website-pixxelschubser.vercel.app/

---

This project is the working repository of my personal website [pixxelschubser](https://pixxelschubser.com/). Here I document the developing process and experiment with new features and changes.

It is also meant as kind of a flag ship in terms of representing my skill in writing clean, simple and lean code as well as working with version control.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
